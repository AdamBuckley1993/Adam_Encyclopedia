        Once upon a time there was a kid named Cinder F. Ella; she was born Cynthia Eleanor but was forced to add the
        name Cinder Effing Ella after her mother died and her father married a cruel woman. She was forced to bathe in her dead 
        mother's ashes, was tortured and humiliated by her stepmother, 2 stepsisters and father and when invited to the festival
        the stepmother forced one stepsister to cut off her toe to fit into the shoe but that didn't work and the lie was discovered so
        the other stepsister was forced to cut off a piece of her heel and again, the lie was found out. Finally, the prince found her and she left
        her cruel, evil, mean family and 2 birds poked out the eyes of one stepsister but Cinderella saved the other stepsister 
        and punished the birds for cruel and unusual punishment; however, the father and stepmother went to jail for life for their crimes against
        Cinderella. While they all lived crappily ever after, Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after and had a crap-ton of kids.
