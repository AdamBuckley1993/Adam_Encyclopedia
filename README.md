# Adam_Encyclopedia 
This is a website about a constantly updated library of dad jokes, inspirational quotes and feel-good stories called Adam's Encyclopedia of Dad Jokes, Inspirational Quotes and Feel-Good Stories! It's my final project for the Code Kentucky Web Development Part 1 course! Feel free to use this as a basis for your web development bootcamp learning! Enjoy, y'all!
For my CSS criteria, I have a hamburger menu for all the links of the website! 
For my JavaScript criteria, the user clicks on the 3-lined bars to use that hamburger menu!
I also have some CSS queries - 2 of them: Flexbox and CSS grid!
