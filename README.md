# Adam_Encyclopedia 
This is a website about a constantly updated library of dad jokes, inspirational quotes and feel-good stories called Adam's Encyclopedia of Dad Jokes, Inspirational Quotes and Feel-Good Stories! It's my final project for the Code Kentucky Web Development Part 1 course! Feel free to use this as a basis for your web development bootcamp learning! Enjoy, y'all!
For my CSS criteria, I have a hamburger menu for all the links of the website! 
For my JavaScript criteria, the user clicks on the 3-lined bars to use that hamburger menu!

I also have some CSS queries - 2 of them: Flexbox and CSS grid!

Here are the 3 things from the Features List that I implemented:
- Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.
- A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
- Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a desktop.
